# ACL-Crocodiles' Online Learning System

This project is an online learning system website for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce
 

## Motivation

We are students at the German University in Cairo and this project was done as a part of the "Advanced Computer Lab" course. 
The project contributes 85% to the course's total grade.
Not only was the huge effect on our grade our motivation, but we were also very eager to learn the MERN stack development and made sure to provide a more than adequate product.
## Build Status

- If the instructor uploads a wrong format of embed video link it will show up weird things instead of the video.
- If the admin grants/denies a request/refund it the buttons will be diabled but the request won't disappear until the page is refreshed.
## Code Style

We have used standardJS code style.
